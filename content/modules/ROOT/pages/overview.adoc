== Intro


In the workshop today, weâ€™ll be covering a brief introduction to OpenShift & CockroachDB and an overview of the problem statement (dual writes) and how you can overcome it with a transactional outbox pattern. You will also go through how to implement it with CockroachDB and Kafka on OpenShift in the following lab modules:

Module 1: Application and Database Setup

Module 2: Setting up Kafka (AMQ Streams)

Module 3: Configuring the changefeed for CockroachDB

Module 4: EDA Microservices
